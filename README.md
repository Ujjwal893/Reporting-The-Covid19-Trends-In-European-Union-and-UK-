# Reporting-The-Covid19-Trends-In-European-Union-and-UK-Future-Ready-Talent-Program Project


Problem Statement :  We are trying to make a platform to give the information of the covid pandemic situation in EU and UK and publish in the form of Power BI reports .This will

show the date trends in caes and deaths done ,the RT PCR testing rate as well as hospital and ICU occupancy rates.These Power BI reports will be very helpful to the authorities to ramp up their preperation according to the evolving scenario

Project Description :  The project tries to give visualisation of the evolving covid pandemic situation in EU and UK on a daily basis.The dataset for the total cases,casualities

has been taken from the European Center for disease control (ECDC ) website.The testing data has been taken from the Eurostat website We have used Azure Blob storage and Azure Datalake Gen2 for data ingestion and built robust pipelines and dataflows for the transformation of the data extracted from the website using Azure Datafactory .The reports have been published using Power BI

Primary Azure Technology : Azure Data Factory,Azure Blob Storage,Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Other Azure Technologies used: Azure HDInsight for running Hive script Azure DataBricks for dataset processing. Azure Datalake Gen2 for handling of the daily updating processed 

data from the ECDC and Eurostat website when event is triggered

Some Screenshots of the Power BI report is as follows :
